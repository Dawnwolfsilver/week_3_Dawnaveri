        The silver clan is busy around the spring moon because most of the new pups are born. All the she-wolves that are in labor have to have food brought to them. One of the she-wolves goes into a cave toward the edge of the clan's territory. Her name is Spotted Leaf, and she is my mother. She is without her mate because he was killed in the Battle of the Edge against the Dark Claw clan. The sound of thundering hoofs rings in my ears as I race across the open plains of Westwind. The sun shines overhead while I dart into the thicket. My name is Stella Luna, and I am a black wolf of Silver Clan. Our clan is on the small side because of the Battle of the Edge ten years ago. That is enough about the past. I am just about to catch my most excellent prey, the White Deer. As I head back to the village, I can smell the scents of River clan wolves, and it seems they're here for the autumn moon meeting of the clans at the Star Stones. We have never really been on the best of terms with the Dark Claw clan, so the River clan decided to be our escorts these past few years. I put my catch of the day in the food storage and find Spark Night to hear about any good news.

      I just entered the tavern as Spark was beginning to share with the clan's members the news of the day. He told about the changes that will probably happen at the meeting. Then he said he got some secret information from other wolves traveling around. The report was that there might be a spy among the Silver clan. That night I went out for a stroll when I overheard a conversation between Warlock and a Dark Claw wolf. I could not believe my eyes; Warlock was the traitor! I hurried back to the village, but I forgot to be quiet, so I snapped a branch on the way back. The next day there was a village meeting, and just as Warlock stepped up, his gaze fell on me. Then in his rumbling voice, he pronounced me as the traitor! I was then sent to the underground prison. The weeks rolled by, and then one night, I heard the clanking at the window. I looked up, and there was Flash, my childhood friend! He told me to back away from the window, and when I did so, he yanked the bars off. I was able to climb out, but I looked at the valley in horror when I did. The whole village was deserted! I glanced at Flash, and then he told me that Dark Claw and Silver clans were fighting in Soldier Gorge and that we were losing with many wounded or dead. We hurried to the battlefield, and then I heard the voices of those who were gone from this world. They told me that I had the power to save Dark Claw and Silver clans with the Moon Tears, which my family possessed. That instant, I saw the Dark matter, the root of all hardships in Westeria, which engulfed both clans. My friend Flash pleads with me not to go, but I told him it was my duty as a Silver clan wolf. When I got to the edge of the aura, I heard a voice. It asked what I wanted to exchange for the Moon Tears, and it said that to save both clans, I would have to give up my life. I thought for a few minutes, then said I give my life for both tribes. As soon as I said that, I could feel my life energy flow out. The last thing I saw was Flash holding me, and both clans shocked howls. I was happy that they were no longer fighting.

        "Crash!"<br>
        "Fuck!"<br>
        "What Happened, Lily?"<br>
        "Oh! Carol, my hand slipped, and I dropped one of the coffee cups..."<br>
        I tuned out the rest of the conversation. I focused back on watching the people scurry around outside in the late afternoon. A slight screech to my left alerts me that my friend Leon finally decided to show up to our monthly meet up at La Luna e Stelle Cafe. Translated as The Moon and Stars Cafe. It is a quaint cafe taking up two floors of the building that always combines blues, jazz, and Spanish music. This cafe works well as a meet up because the general public thinks the restaurant is the number one place to study or have private conversations.Turning to scan my friend to see that he is as sharp looking as always. Dress in a button-up white shirt with a gray and blue vest and black Khaki pants and brown dress shoes. And of course, how could I forget the white fedora decorated with the Renegades symbol. I preferred dressing in skinny black jeans and a teal t-shirt under a light silver and gold tiger-striped scarf that can cover the entirety of my face in stark contrast."So Leon, what was the hold up this time?" I shoot sarcastically.<br>
	      Chuckling, he responds, "Had to wrap up a case close to O'Hare airport. I hope I didn't delay us too long, Dawn."<br>
	      Waving my hand dismissively, I say, "No worries, the only interesting thing that has happened is that a barista dropped a coffee cup."<br>
 	      Sighing, Leon states, "You Know that is not what I am asking about, right?"<br>
	      "Eh, it was worth a shot of trying to divert the question. But really, we didn't lose that much time. So no worries, okay."<br>
	      Getting comfortable, Leon sighed, "If you say so, Dawn. So any new changes here in the South Loop?"<br>
	      "There has been quite a lot of activity in Grant Park and Millennium Park. Sadly that means I am getting very little break time."

        A clinking to our left shows a cafe employee setting down an espresso coffee with a medium blueberry muffin.<br>
	      "Your coffee and muffin, sir." the young man drawls.<br>
	      While Leon turns to thank the young man, I turn my attention to the other occupants of the cafe's upper level. The first people I notice are the small group of multi-racial young adolescents. They seem to be planning to play the instruments by their sides somewhere near here. The next people I observe are several working on their laptops. I then feel a light tap on my arm.<br>
	      "Here, Dawn, I bet you haven't had something to eat yet today like always," Leon states exasperatingly as he slides the blueberry muffin over.<br>
	      Sighing, I lightly pinch off a piece of the muffin to eat. By now, Leon knows me too well to not realize that I don't do so well in caring for my own needs when acting like a workaholic. After stuffing myself with a quarter of the surprising good muffin, I pick our conversation back up. "Any news on your end about the possible match on the oni masked killer?"

        Blinking quickly, Leon leans toward me and quietly asks," How do you know about it? Your team should not be informed about this matter yet."<br>
	      "I have my sources." I carefully reply.<br>
	      "Care to let me meet your sources?" Leon flatly tells me as our eye lock in a stalemate of wills.<br>
	      Raising a single eyebrow, I reply, "Are you finally considering working under me?" After I state my question, Leon finally breaks eye contact by turning to the widows in front of us to stare unseeingly into the distance. I turn back to my muffin to wait for Leon to return from wherever he has gone. When I am on my last piece of the muffin, and the sky turns darker, is when I hear a hitch in Leon's breathing and know that he is back to the present. So I seriously say, "Like I always tell you, take your time to decide, but I can't introduce you to my sources if you are still going to be a part of the Renegades."<br>
	      "yeah, I remember just it is hard to leave with Layla still there fighting." Leon lets out frustratedly.<br>
        When Leon said Layla, my eyes widen with realization. Layla is one of my sources, which means that Leon knows she is a traitor and only stays cause. And just as quickly does my mind tell me that the situation is much more complicated than the previously known.
